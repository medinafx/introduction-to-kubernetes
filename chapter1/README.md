## From Monolith to Microservices

Microservices can be deployed individually on separate servers provisioned with fewer resources - only what is required by each service and the host system itself, helping to lower compute resource expenses.

Microservices-based architecture is aligned with Event-driven Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, where complex applications are composed of small independent processes which communicate with each other through APIs over a network. APIs allow access by other internal services of the same application or external, third-party services and applications.

Each microservice is developed and written in a modern programming language, selected to be the best suitable for the type of service and its business function. This offers a great deal of flexibility when matching microservices with specific hardware when required, allowing deployments on inexpensive commodity hardware.

Although the distributed nature of microservices adds complexity to the architecture, one of the greatest benefits of microservices is scalability. With the overall application becoming modular, each microservice can be scaled individually, either manually or automated through demand-based autoscaling.
